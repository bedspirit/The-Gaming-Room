# The-Gaming-Room

Our client, The Gaming Room, would like to develop a web based game that serves multiple platforms based on their Android app, "Draw It or Lose It".

I felt that my descriptions of the server side and client side development requirements were well researched and articulated.

The UML diagram was particularly helpful in the development of the code.  Much of the code I wrote came directly from the diagram.

I could have gone into more detail about the memory management.  Perhaps it may have been beneficial to lay out scenarios where memory might not be sufficient and describe what the impact on the game would be.

Our client specified their needs, but we didn't get direct input from a potential user on what their needs may be, but we can speculate.  It's a safe assumption that the user would prefer a game that is quick and responsive, so we built a strategy to use memory as effieciently as possible.  We also assume the user would prefer a game that is secure and fair so we built a system that would prevent unauthorized access and strategized ways to protect against hacking.  Without users, the game will cease to exist so their addressing their needs is essential to the success of the project. 

The portion of the software we designed focused a couple of the specific needs expressed by the client. Taking those needs and trying to determine the impacts and consequnces of those needs is key.  For example, the client wanted a game that would work on multiple platforms.  We identified the specific platforms and what would be required to get this game to work on each one.
